How to use this template:
Role: Tell the AI who it should be. The more specific the better. For example, instead of "writer," try "an expert blog post writer who specializes in tech topics."

Objective: What is the final deliverable? Is it a marketing plan, a piece of code, or a story outline? Be explicit.

Context: This is where you give the AI the background info. For a blog post, this might include your target audience, tone, or SEO keywords.

Instructions: List the steps the AI should follow to complete the task. This is the most crucial part. A great example would be: "Generate three unique headline options," "Write an introduction paragraph that hooks the reader," "Draft three bullet points for the main body of the post."

Notes: Use this section for any final tips or reminders. This could include things to avoid, formatting preferences, or specific examples to follow.
